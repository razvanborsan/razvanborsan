# Hi, I'm Razvan! 👋🏻

I'm a software engineer currently working on web applications. I graduated from UAIC Iasi, Romania in 2021 with a Master's Degree in Computer Science, where I studied the field of Distributed Systems. I am passionate about history, science and computers; I could talk for hours about any of the three! 

I also enjoy honing my software development skills in my spare time; I have an interest in algorithmic approaches and cloud development. I wish to become a software developer that can lead and inspire others with his dedication an passion.

I encourage you to take a look at my repositories and play around with my fun projects. If you have any feedback or find any bugs, please reach out to me!
